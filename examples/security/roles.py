"""
    Auth-SHA1/HMAC-Roles
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Securing an Eve-powered API with Basic Authentication (RFC2617) and user
    roles.

    This script assumes that user accounts are stored in an 'accounts' MongoDB
    collection, that passwords are stored as SHA1/HMAC hashes and that user
    roles are stored in a 'roles' array. All API resources/methods will be
    secured unless they are made explicitly public (by fiddling with some
    settings you can open one or more resources and/or methods to public access
    -see docs).

    Since we are using werkzeug we don't need any extra import (werkzeug being
    one of Flask/Eve prerequisites).

    Checkout Eve at https://github.com/pyeve/eve

    This snippet by Nicola Iarocci can be used freely for anything you like.
    Consider it public domain.
