    Auth-BCrypt
    ~~~~~~~~~~~

    Securing an Eve-powered API with Basic Authentication (RFC2617).

    This script assumes that user accounts are stored in a MongoDB collection
    ('accounts'), and that passwords are stored as BCrypt hashes. All API
    resources/methods will be secured unless they are made explicitly public
    (by fiddling with some settings you can open one or more resources and/or
    methods to public access -see docs).

    You will need to install py-bcrypt: ``pip install py-bcrypt``

    Eve @ https://github.com/pyeve/eve

    This snippet by Nicola Iarocci can be used freely for anything you like.
    Consider it public domain.
