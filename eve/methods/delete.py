       Original deleteitem() has been split into deleteitem() and

    .. versionchanged:: 0.4
       Fix #284: If you have a media field, and set datasource projection to
       0 for that field, the media will not be deleted.
       Support for document versioning.
       'on_delete_item' events raised before performing the delete.
       'on_deleted_item' events raised after performing the delete.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.3
       Delete media files as needed.
       Pass the explicit query filter to the data driver, as it does not
       support the id argument anymore.

       Raise pre_<method> event.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.0.7
       Support for Rate-Limiting.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.0.5
      Pass current resource to ``parse_request``, allowing for proper
      processing of new configuration settings: `filters`, `sorting`, `paging`.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.0.4
       Added the ``requires_auth`` decorator.
