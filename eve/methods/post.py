    Intended for internal post calls, this method is not rate limited,
    authentication is not checked and pre-request events are not raised.
    Adds one or more documents to a resource. Each document is validated
    against the domain schema. If validation passes the document is inserted
    and ID_FIELD, LAST_UPDATED and DATE_CREATED along with a link to the
    document are returned. If validation fails, a list of validation issues
    is returned.

    :param resource: name of the resource involved.
    :param payl: alternative payload. When calling post() from your own code
                 you can provide an alternative payload. This can be useful,
                 for example, when you have a callback function hooked to a
                 certain endpoint, and want to perform additional post() calls
                 from there.

                 Please be advised that in order to successfully use this
                 option, a request context must be available.

                 See https://github.com/nicolaiarocci/eve/issues/74 for a
                 discussion, and a typical use case.
    :param skip_validation: skip payload validation before write (bool)

    .. versionchanged:: 0.6
       Fix: since v0.6, skip_validation = True causes a 422 response (#726).

    .. versionchanged:: 0.6
       Initialize DELETED field when soft_delete is enabled.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.5
       Back to resolving default values after validaton as now the validator
       can properly validate dependency even when some have default values. See
       #353.
       Push updates to the OpLog.
       Original post() has been split into post() and post_internal().
       ETAGS are now stored with documents (#369).

    .. versionchanged:: 0.4
       Resolve default values before validation is performed. See #353.
       Support for document versioning.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.3
       Return 201 if at least one document has been successfully inserted.
       Fix #231 auth field not set if resource level authentication is set.
       Support for media fields.
       When IF_MATCH is disabled, no etag is included in the payload.
       Support for new validation format introduced with Cerberus v0.5.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.2
       Use the new STATUS setting.
       Use the new ISSUES setting.
       Raise 'on_pre_<method>' event.
       Explictly resolve default values instead of letting them be resolved
       by common.parse. This avoids a validation error when a read-only field
       also has a default value.
       Added ``on_inserted*`` events after the database insert

    .. versionchanged:: 0.1.1
       auth.request_auth_value is now used to store the auth_field value.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.1.0
       More robust handling of auth_field.
       Support for optional HATEOAS.

    .. versionchanged: 0.0.9
       Event hooks renamed to be more robuts and consistent: 'on_posting'
       renamed to 'on_insert'.
       You can now pass a pre-defined custom payload to the funcion.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.0.9
       Storing self.app.auth.userid in auth_field when 'user-restricted
       resource access' is enabled.

    .. versionchanged: 0.0.7
       Support for Rate-Limiting.
       Support for 'extra_response_fields'.

       'on_posting' and 'on_posting_<resource>' events are raised before the
       documents are inserted into the database. This allows callback functions
       to arbitrarily edit/update the documents being stored.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.0.6
       Support for bulk inserts.

       Please note: validation constraints are checked against the database,
       and not between the payload documents themselves. This causes an
       interesting corner case: in the event of a multiple documents payload
       where two or more documents carry the same value for a field where the
       'unique' constraint is set, the payload will validate successfully, as
       there are no duplicates in the database (yet). If this is an issue, the
       client can always send the documents once at a time for insertion, or
       validate locally before submitting the payload to the API.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.0.5
       Support for 'application/json' Content-Type .
       Support for 'user-restricted resource access'.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.0.4
       Added the ``requires_auth`` decorator.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.0.3
       JSON links. Superflous ``response`` container removed.
