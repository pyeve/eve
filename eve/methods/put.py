    """ Intended for internal put calls, this method is not rate limited,
    authentication is not checked, pre-request events are not raised, and
    concurrency checking is optional. Performs a document replacement.
    Updates are first validated against the resource schema. If validation
    passes, the document is repalced and an OK status update is returned.
    If validation fails a set of validation issues is returned.

    :param resource: the name of the resource to which the document belongs.
    :param payload: alternative payload. When calling put() from your own code
                    you can provide an alternative payload. This can be useful,
                    for example, when you have a callback function hooked to a
                    certain endpoint, and want to perform additional put()
                    callsfrom there.

                    Please be advised that in order to successfully use this
                    option, a request context must be available.
    :param concurrency_check: concurrency check switch (bool)
    :param skip_validation: skip payload validation before write (bool)
    :param **lookup: document lookup query.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.6
       Create document if it does not exist. Closes #634.
       Allow restoring soft deleted documents via PUT

    .. versionchanged:: 0.5
       Back to resolving default values after validaton as now the validator
       can properly validate dependency even when some have default values. See
       #353.
       Original put() has been split into put() and put_internal().
       You can now pass a pre-defined custom payload to the funcion.
       ETAG is now stored with the document (#369).
       Catching all HTTPExceptions and returning them to the caller, allowing
       for eventual flask.abort() invocations in callback functions to go
       through. Fixes #395.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.4
       Allow abort() to be inoked by callback functions.
       Resolve default values before validation is performed. See #353.
       Raise 'on_replace' instead of 'on_insert'. The callback function gets
       the document (as opposed to a list of just 1 document) as an argument.
       Support for document versioning.
       Raise `on_replaced` after the document has been replaced

    .. versionchanged:: 0.3
       Support for media fields.
       When IF_MATCH is disabled, no etag is included in the payload.
       Support for new validation format introduced with Cerberus v0.5.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.2
       Use the new STATUS setting.
       Use the new ISSUES setting.
       Raise pre_<method> event.
       explictly resolve default values instead of letting them be resolved
       by common.parse. This avoids a validation error when a read-only field
       also has a default value.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.1.1
       auth.request_auth_value is now used to store the auth_field value.
       Item-identifier wrapper stripped from both request and response payload.
