Eve is an open source Python REST API framework designed for human beings. It
allows to effortlessly build and deploy highly customizable, fully featured
RESTful Web Services. Eve offers native support for MongoDB, and SQL backends
via community extensions.

Eve is Simple
-------------
.. code-block:: python

    from eve import Eve

    app = Eve()
    app.run()

The API is now live, ready to be consumed:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -i http://example.com/people
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

All you need to bring your API online is a database, a configuration file
(defaults to ``settings.py``) and a launch script.  Overall, you will find that
configuring and fine-tuning your API is a very simple process.
