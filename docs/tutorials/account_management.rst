RESTful Account Management
==========================
.. admonition:: Please note

    This tutorial assumes that you've read the :ref:`quickstart` and the
    :ref:`auth` guides.

Except for the relatively rare occurence of open (and generally read-only) public
APIs, most services are only accessible to authenticated users.  A common
pattern is that users create their account on a website or with a mobile
application.  Once they have an account, they are allowed to consume one or more
APIs. This is the model followed by most social networks and service providers
(Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, etc.) So how do you, the service provider, manage
to create, edit and delete accounts while using the same API that is being
consumed by the accounts themselves?

In the following paragraphs we'll see a couple of possible Account Management
implementations, both making intensive use of a host of Eve features such as
:ref:`endpointsec`, :ref:`roleaccess`, :ref:`user-restricted`,
:ref:`eventhooks`. 

We assume that SSL/TLS is enabled, which means that our transport layer is
encrypted, making both :ref:`basic` and :ref:`token` valid options to secure API
endpoints. 

Let's say we're upgrading the API we defined in the :ref:`quickstart` tutorial.

.. _accounts_basic:

Accounts with Basic Authentication
-----------------------------------
Our tasks are as follows:

1. Make an endpoint available for all account management activities
   (``/accounts``). 
2. Secure the endpoint, so that it is only accessible to clients
   that we control: our own website, mobile apps with account
   management capabilities, etc.
3. Make sure that all other API endpoints are only accessible to authenticated
   accounts (created by means of the above mentioned endpoint).
4. Allow authenticated users to only access resources created by themselves.

1. The ``/accounts`` endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The account management endpoint is no different than any other API endpoint.
It is just a matter of declaring it in our settings file. Let's declare the
resource schema first.

::

        schema =  {
            'username': {
                'type': 'string',
                'required': True,
                'unique': True,
                },
            'password': {
                'type': 'string',
                'required': True,
            },
        },

Then, let's define the endpoint.

::

    accounts = {
        # the standard account entry point is defined as
        # '/accounts/<ObjectId>'. We define  an additional read-only entry 
        # point accessible at '/accounts/<username>'. 
        'additional_lookup': {
            'url': '[\w]+',
            'field': 'username',
        },

        # We also disable endpoint caching as we don't want client apps to
        # cache account data.
        'cache_control': '',
        'cache_expires': 0,

        # Finally, let's add the schema definition for this endpoint.
        'schema': schema,
    }

We defined an additional read-only entry point at ``/accounts/<username>``.
This isn't really a necessity, but it can come in handy to easily verify if
a username has been taken already, or to retrieve an account without knowing
its ``ObjectId`` beforehand. Of course, both pieces of information can also be
found by querying the resource endpoint (``/accounts?where={"username":
"johndoe"}``), but then we would need to parse the response payload, whereas by
hitting our new endpoint with a GET request we will obtain the bare account
data, or a ``404 Not Found`` if the account does not exist.

Once the endpoint has been configured, we need to add it to the API domain:

::

    DOMAIN['accounts'] = accounts


2. Securing the ``/accounts/`` endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2a. Hard-coding our way in
''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Securing the endpoint can be achieved by allowing only well-known `superusers`
to operate on it. Our authentication class, which is defined in the launch
script, can be hard-coded to handle the case:

.. code-block:: python

    import bcrypt
    from eve import Eve
    from eve.auth import BasicAuth


    class BCryptAuth(BasicAuth):
        def check_auth(self, username, password, allowed_roles, resource, method):
            if resource = 'accounts':
                return username == 'superuser' and password = 'password'
            else:
                # use Eve's own db driver; no additional connections/resources are used
                accounts = app.data.driver.db['accounts']
                account = accounts.find_one({'username': username})
                return account and \
                    bcrypt.hashpw(password, account['password']) == account['password']


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app = Eve(auth=BCryptAuth)
        app.run()

Thus, only the ``superuser`` account will be allowed to consume the
``accounts`` endpoint, while standard authentication logic will apply to all
other endpoints. Our mobile app (say) will add accounts by hitting the endpoint
with simple POST requests, of course authenticating itself as a `superuser` by
means of the `Authorization` header. The script assumes that stored passwords
are encrypted with `bcrypt` (storing passwords as plain text is *never* a good
idea). See :ref:`basic` for an alternative, faster but less secure SHA1/MAC
example. 

2b. User Roles Access Control
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Hard-coding usernames and passwords might very well do the job, but it is
hardly the best approach that we can take here. What if another `superurser`
account needs access to the endpoint? Updating the script each time
a privileged user joins the ranks does not seem appropriate (it isn't).
Fortunately, the :ref:`roleaccess` feature can help us here. You see where we
are going with this: the idea is that only accounts with `superuser` and
`admin` roles will be granted access to the endpoint.

Let's start by updating our resource schema.

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 10-14

        schema =  {
            'username': {
                'type': 'string',
                'required': True,
                },
            'password': {
                'type': 'string',
                'required': True,
            },
            'roles': {
                'type': 'list',
                'allowed': ['user', 'superuser', 'admin'],
                'required': True,
            }
        },

We just added a new ``roles`` field which is a required list. From now on, one
or more roles will have to be assigned on account creation. 

Now we need to restrict endpoint access to `superuser` and `admin` accounts
only so let's update the endpoint definition accordingly.

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 16

    accounts = {
        # the standard account entry point is defined as
        # '/accounts/<ObjectId>'. We define  an additional read-only entry 
        # point accessible at '/accounts/<username>'. 
        'additional_lookup': {
            'url': '[\w]+',
            'field': 'username',
        },

        # We also disable endpoint caching as we don't want client apps to
        # cache account data.
        'cache_control': '',
        'cache_expires': 0,

        # Only allow superusers and admins.
        'allowed_roles': ['superuser', 'admin'],
        
        # Finally, let's add the schema definition for this endpoint.
        'schema': schema,
    }

Finally, a rewrite of our authentication class is in order.

.. code-block:: python

    from eve import Eve
    from eve.auth import BasicAuth
    from werkzeug.security import check_password_hash


    class RolesAuth(BasicAuth):
        def check_auth(self, username, password, allowed_roles, resource, method):
            # use Eve's own db driver; no additional connections/resources are used
            accounts = app.data.driver.db['accounts']
            lookup = {'username': username}
            if allowed_roles:
                # only retrieve a user if his roles match ``allowed_roles``
                lookup['roles'] = {'$in': allowed_roles}
            account = accounts.find_one(lookup)
            return account and check_password_hash(account['password'], password)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app = Eve(auth=RolesAuth)
        app.run()

What the above snippet does is secure all API endpoints with role-base access
control. It is, in fact, the same snippet seen in :ref:`roleaccess`. This
technique allows us to keep the code untouched as we add more `superuser` or
`admin` accounts (and we'll probably be adding them by accessing our very own
API). Also, should the need arise, we could easily restrict access to more
endpoints just by updating the settings file, again without touching the
authentication class.

3. Securing other API endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This will be quick, as both the `hard-coding` and the `role-based` access
control approaches above effectively secure all API endpoints already.  Passing
an authentication class to the ``Eve`` object enables authentication for the
whole API: every time an endpoint is hit with a request, the class instance is
invoked.

Of course, you can still fine-tune security, for example by allowing public
access to certain endpoints, or to certain HTTP methods. See :ref:`auth` for
more details.

4. Only allowing access to account resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most of the time when you allow Authenticated users to store data, you only
want them to access their own data. This can be convenientely achieved by
using the :ref:`user-restricted` feature. When enabled, each stored document is
associated with the account that created it. This allows the API to transparently
serve only account-created documents on all kind of requests: read, edit, delete
and of course create.

There are only two things that we need to do in order to activate this feature:

    1. configure the name of the field that will be used to store the owner of the
    document
    2. set the document owner on each incoming POST request.


Since we want to enable this feature for all of our API endpoints we'll just
update our ``settings.py`` file by setting a proper ``AUTH_FIELD`` value:

::

    # Name of the field used to store the owner of each document
    AUTH_FIELD = 'user_id'


Then, we want to update our authentication class to properly update the field's
value:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 15-17
   

    from eve import Eve
    from eve.auth import BasicAuth
    from werkzeug.security import check_password_hash


    class RolesAuth(BasicAuth):
        def check_auth(self, username, password, allowed_roles, resource, method):
            # use Eve's own db driver; no additional connections/resources are used
            accounts = app.data.driver.db['accounts']
            lookup = {'username': username}
            if allowed_roles:
                # only retrieve a user if his roles match ``allowed_roles``
                lookup['roles'] = {'$in': allowed_roles}
            account = accounts.find_one(lookup)
            # set 'AUTH_FIELD' value to the account's ObjectId 
            # (instead of _Id, you might want to use ID_FIELD)
            self.request_auth_value = account['_id']
            return account and check_password_hash(account['password'], password)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app = Eve(auth=RolesAuth)
        app.run()

This is all we need to do. Now, when a user hits the, say, ``/invoices``
endpoint with a GET request, he will only be served with the invoices created
by his own account. The same will happen with DELETE and PATCH, making it
impossible for an authenticated user to accidentally retrieve, edit or delete
other people's data.

Accounts with Token Authentication
----------------------------------
As seen in :ref:`token`, token authentication is just a specialized version of
Basic Authentication. It is actually executed as a standard Basic
Authentication request where the value of the *username* field is used for
the token, and the password field is not provided (if included, it is ignored).

Consequently, handling accounts with Token Authentication is very similar to
what we saw in :ref:`accounts_basic`, but there's one little caveat: tokens
need to be generated and stored along with the account, and eventually returned
to the client. 

In light of this, let's review our updated task list:
  
1. Make an endpoint available for all account management activities
   (``/accounts``). 
2. Secure the endpoint so that it is only accessible to clients (tokens) that
   we control.
3. On account creation, generate and store its token.
4. Optionally, return the new token with the response.
5. Make sure that all other API endpoints are only accessible to authenticated
   tokens.
6. Allow authenticated users to only access resources created by themselves

1. The ``/accounts/`` endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This isn't any different than what we did in :ref:`accounts_basic`. We just
need to add the `token` field to our schema:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 16-19

        schema =  {
            'username': {
                'type': 'string',
                'required': True,
                'unique': True,
                },
            'password': {
                'type': 'string',
                'required': True,
            },
            'roles': {
                'type': 'list',
                'allowed': ['user', 'superuser', 'admin'],
                'required': True,
            },
            'token': {
                'type': 'string',
                'required': True,
            }
        }

2. Securing the ``/accounts/`` endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We defined the `roles` field for the `accounts` schema in the previous step.
We also need to define the endpoint, making sure that we set the allowed 
user roles.

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 16

    accounts = {
        # the standard account entry point is defined as
        # '/accounts/<ObjectId>'. We define  an additional read-only entry 
        # point accessible at '/accounts/<username>'. 
        'additional_lookup': {
            'url': '[\w]+',
            'field': 'username',
        },

        # We also disable endpoint caching as we don't want client apps to
        # cache account data.
        'cache_control': '',
        'cache_expires': 0,

        # Only allow superusers and admins.
        'allowed_roles': ['superuser', 'admin'],
        
        # Finally, let's add the schema definition for this endpoint.
        'schema': schema,
    }

And finally, here is our launch script which is, of course, using a ``TokenAuth``
subclass this time around:

.. code-block:: python

    from eve import Eve
    from eve.auth import TokenAuth


    class RolesAuth(TokenAuth):
        def check_auth(self, token,  allowed_roles, resource, method):
            # use Eve's own db driver; no additional connections/resources are used
            accounts = app.data.driver.db['accounts']
            lookup = {'token': token}
            if allowed_roles:
                # only retrieve a user if his roles match ``allowed_roles``
                lookup['roles'] = {'$in': allowed_roles}
            account = accounts.find_one(lookup)
            return account


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app = Eve(auth=RolesAuth)
        app.run()

3. Building custom tokens on account creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The code above has a problem: it won't authenticate anybody, as we aren't
generating any token yet. Consequently, clients aren't getting their auth tokens
back so they don't really know how to authenticate. Let's fix that by using the
awesome :ref:`eventhooks` feature.  We'll update our launch script by
registering a callback function that will be called when a new account is about
to be stored to the database.

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 3-4,19-24,29

    from eve import Eve
    from eve.auth import TokenAuth
    import random
    import string


    class RolesAuth(TokenAuth):
        def check_auth(self, token,  allowed_roles, resource, method):
            # use Eve's own db driver; no additional connections/resources are used
            accounts = app.data.driver.db['accounts']
            lookup = {'token': token}
            if allowed_roles:
                # only retrieve a user if his roles match ``allowed_roles``
                lookup['roles'] = {'$in': allowed_roles}
            account = accounts.find_one(lookup)
            return account


    def add_token(documents):
        # Don't use this in production:
        # You should at least make sure that the token is unique.
        for document in documents:
            document["token"] = (''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase) 
                                         for x in range(10)))


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app = Eve(auth=RolesAuth)
        app.on_insert_accounts += add_token
        app.run()

As you can see, we are subscribing to the ``on_insert`` event of the `accounts`
endpoint with our ``add_token`` function. This callback will receive
`documents` as an argument, which is a list of validated documents accepted for
database insertion. We simply add (or replace in the unlikely case that the
request contained it already) a token to every document, and we're done! For
more information on callbacks, see `Event Hooks`_.

4. Returning the token with the response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Optionally, you might want to return the tokens with the response. Truth be
told, this isn't a very good idea. You generally want to send access
information out-of-band, with an email for example. However we're assuming that
we are on SSL, and there are cases where sending the auth token just makes
sense, like when the client is a mobile application and we want the user to use
the service right away.

Normally, only automatically handled fields (``ID_FIELD``, ``LAST_UPDATED``,
``DATE_CREATED``, ``ETAG``) are included with POST response payloads.
Fortunately, there's a setting which allows us to inject additional fields in
responses, and that is ``EXTRA_RESPONSE_FIELDS``, with its endpoint-level
equivalent, ``extra_response_fields``. All we need to do is update our endpoint
definition accordingly:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 19

    accounts = {
        # the standard account entry point is defined as
        # '/accounts/<ObjectId>'. We define  an additional read-only entry 
        # point accessible at '/accounts/<username>'. 
        'additional_lookup': {
            'url': '[\w]+',
            'field': 'username',
        },

        # We also disable endpoint caching as we don't want client apps to
        # cache account data.
        'cache_control': '',
        'cache_expires': 0,

        # Only allow superusers and admins.
        'allowed_roles': ['superuser', 'admin'],

        # Allow 'token' to be returned with POST responses
        extra_response_fields: ['token'],
        
        # Finally, let's add the schema definition for this endpoint.
        'schema': schema,
    }

From now on responses to POST requests aimed at the ``/accounts`` endpoint
will include the newly generated auth token, allowing the client to consume
other API endpoints right away.

5. Securing other API endpoints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As we've seen before, passing an authentication class to the ``Eve`` object
enables authentication for all API endpoints. Again, you can still fine-tune
security by allowing public access to certain endpoints or to certain HTTP
methods. See :ref:`auth` for more details.

6. Only allowing access to account resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is achieved with the :ref:`user-restricted` feature, as seen in
:ref:`accounts_basic`. You might want to store the user token as your
``AUTH_FIELD`` value, but if you want user tokens to be easily revocable, then
your best option is to use the account unique id for this.

Basic vs Token: Final Considerations
------------------------------------
Despite being a little more tricky to set up on the server side, Token
Authentication offers significant advantages. First, you don't have passwords
stored on the client and  being sent over the wire with every request. If
you're sending your tokens out-of-band, and you're on SSL/TLS, that's quite
a lot of additional security.
