-----

Eve is an :doc:`open source <license>` Python REST API framework designed for
human beings. It allows to effortlessly build and deploy highly customizable,
fully featured RESTful Web Services.

Eve is powered by Flask_ and Cerberus_ and it offers native support for MongoDB_ data
stores. Support for SQL, Elasticsearch and Neo4js backends is provided by
community extensions_.

The codebase is thoroughly tested under Python 2.7, 3.4+, and PyPy.

Eve is Simple
-------------
.. code-block:: python

    from eve import Eve

    app = Eve()
    app.run()

The API is now live, ready to be consumed:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -i http://example.com/people
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

All you need to bring your API online is a database, a configuration file
(defaults to ``settings.py``) and a launch script.  Overall, you will find that
configuring and fine-tuning your API is a very simple process.

Funding Eve
-----------
Eve REST framework is a :doc:`collaboratively funded project <funding>`. If you
run a business and are using Eve in a revenue-generating product, it would make
business sense to sponsor Eve development: it ensures the project that your
product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained. Individual users are
also welcome to make either a recurring pledge or a one time donation if Eve
has helped you in your work or personal projects. Every single sign-up makes
a significant impact towards making Eve possible.

.. _demo:

Live demo
---------
Check out the `live demo`_. If using a browser you will get XML back. For JSON
in the browser, you might want to install Postman_ or similar extension and
then set the ``Accept`` request header to ``application/json``. If you are
a CLI user (and you should), ``curl`` is your friend. The `source code`_ will
show you how easy it is to run an API with Eve. You will also find `usage
examples`_ for all common use cases (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE and more). There
is also a simple `client app`_ available.
