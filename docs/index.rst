Python REST API Framework
=========================
*Powered by Flask, MongoDB, Redis and good intentions Eve allows to
effortlessly build and deploy highly customizable, fully featured RESTful Web
Services*

Eve is Simple
-------------
.. code-block:: python

    from eve import Eve

    app = Eve()
    app.run()

The API is now live, ready to be consumed:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -i http://example.com/people
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

All you need to bring your API online is a database, a configuration file
(defaults to ``settings.py``) and a launch script.  Overall, you will find that
configuring and fine-tuning your API is a very simple process.

Eve is thoroughly tested under Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3 and PyPy.

.. _demo:

Live demo
---------
Check out the `live demo`_. If using a browser you will get XML back. For JSON
in the browser, you might want to install Postman_ or similar extension and
then set the ``Accept`` request header to ``application/json``. If you are
a CLI guy (and you should), ``curl`` is your friend. The `source code`_ will
show you how easy it is to run an API with Eve. You will also find `usage
examples`_ for all common use cases (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE and more). There
is also a simple `client app`_ available.
