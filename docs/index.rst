Eve is an :doc:`open source <license>` Python REST API framework designed for
human beings. It allows to effortlessly build and deploy highly customizable,
fully featured RESTful Web Services.

Eve is powered by Flask_ and Cerberus_ and it offers native support for
MongoDB_ data stores. Support for SQL, Elasticsearch and Neo4js backends is
provided by community extensions_.

The codebase is thoroughly tested under Python 3.9+, and PyPy.

Eve is Simple
-------------
.. code-block:: python

    from eve import Eve

    settings = {'DOMAIN': {'people': {}}}

    app = Eve(settings=settings)
    app.run()

The API is now live, ready to be consumed:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -i http://example.com/people
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

All you need to bring your API online is a database, a configuration file
(defaults to ``settings.py``) or dictionary, and a launch script. Overall, you
will find that configuring and fine-tuning your API is a very simple process.
