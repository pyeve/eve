Configuration Handling
======================
Generally Eve configuration is best done with configuration files. The
configuration files themselves are actual Python files. 

Configuration Files
-------------------
On startup Eve will look for a `settings.py` file in the application folder.
You can choose an alternative filename/path, just pass it as an argument when
you instantiate the application.

::
    
    from eve import Eve

    app = Eve(settings='my_settings.py')
    app.run()

Development / Production
''''''''''''''''''''''''
Most applications need more than one configuration. There should be at least
separate configurations for the production server and the one used during
development. The easiest way to handle this is to use a default configuration
that is always loaded and part of the version control, and a separate
configuration that overrides the values as necessary.

This is the main reason why you can override or extend the settings with the
contents of the file the :envvar:`EVE_SETTINGS` environment variable points to.
The development/local settings could be stored in `settings.py` and then, in
production, you could export EVE_SETTINGS=/path/to/production_setting.py, and
you are done. 

There are many alternative ways to handle development/production
however. Using Python modules for configuration is very convenient, as they
allow for all kind of nice tricks, like being able to seamlessly launch the
same API on both local and production systems, connecting to the appropriate
database instance as needed.  Consider the following example, taken directly
from the :ref:`demo`:

::

    # We want to seamlessy run our API both locally and on Heroku, so:
    if os.environ.get('PORT'):
        # We're hosted on Heroku! Use the MongoHQ sandbox as our backend.
        MONGO_HOST = 'alex.mongohq.com'
        MONGO_PORT = 10047
        MONGO_USERNAME = '<user>'
        MONGO_PASSWORD = '<pw>'
        MONGO_DBNAME = '<dbname>'

        # also, correctly set the API entry point
        SERVER_NAME = 'eve-demo.herokuapp.com'
    else:
        # Running on local machine. Let's just use the local mongod instance.

        # Please note that MONGO_HOST and MONGO_PORT could very well be left
        # out as they already default to a bare bones local 'mongod' instance.
        MONGO_HOST = 'localhost'
        MONGO_PORT = 27017
        MONGO_USERNAME = 'user'
        MONGO_PASSWORD = 'user'
        MONGO_DBNAME = 'apitest'

        # let's not forget the API entry point
        SERVER_NAME = 'localhost:5000'


.. _global:

Global Configuration
--------------------
Besides defining the general API behaviour, most global configuration settings
are used to define the standard endpoint ruleset, and can be fine-tuned later,
when configuring individual endpoints. Global configuration settings are always
uppercase.

                                will be silently replaced with this value.
                                You want to aim for a reasonable compromise
                                between performance and transfer size. Defaults
                                to 50.

``PAGINATION_DEFAULT``          Default value for ``max_results`` applied when

                                ``datetime`` values. In responses, ``datetime``
                                values will be rendered as JSON strings using
                                this format. Defaults to the RFC1123 (ex RFC

                                themselves. The keyword contains the actual
                                name of the field used to store the username of
                                the user who created the resource item. Can be
                                overwritten by resource settings. Defaults to
                                ``''``, which disables the feature. 

``ALLOW_UNKNOWN``               When ``True`` this option will allow insertion
                                and edition of arbitrary, unknown fields to
                                any API endpoint. Use with caution. See

                                every POST response. Normally only
                                automatically handled fields (``ID_FIELD``,
                                ``LAST_UPDATED``, ``DATE_CREATED``, ``etag``)
                                are included in response payloads. Can be
                                overridden by resource settings. Defaults to

                                (``?where=``). Defaults to ``['$where',
                                '$regex']``. 
                                
                                Mongo JavaScript operators are disabled by
                                default as they might be used as vectors for
                                injection attacks. Javascript queries also tend
                                to be slow and generally can be easily replaced
                                with the (very rich) Mongo query dialect.

``MONGO_WRITE_CONCERN``         A dictionary defining MongoDB write concern
                                settings. All stadard write concern settings 
                                (w, wtimeout, j, fsync) are supported. Defaults
                                to ``{'w': 1}`` which means 'do regular
                                aknowledged writes' (this is also the Mongo
                                default.)

                                Please be aware that setting 'w' to a value of
                                2 or greater requires replication to be active
                                or you will be getting 500 errors (the write
                                will still happen; Mongo will just be unable
                                to check that it's being written to multiple
                                servers.)
                                
                                Can be overridden at endpoint (Mongo
                                collection) level. See ``mongo_write_concern``
                                below.

``DOMAIN``                      A dict holding the API domain definition.
                                See `Domain Configuration`_.
=============================== =========================================

.. _domain:

Domain Configuration
--------------------
In Eve terminology `domain` is the definition of the API structure, the area
where you design your API, fine-tune resources endpoints, and define validation
rules. 

``DOMAIN`` is a :ref:`global configuration setting <global>`: a Python
dictionary where keys are API resources and values their definitions. 

::

    # Here we define two API endpoints, 'people' and 'works', leaving their
    # definitions empty.
    DOMAIN = {
        'people': {},
        'works': {},
        }

In the following two sections we will customize the `people` resource.

.. _local:

Resource / Item Endpoints
'''''''''''''''''''''''''
Endpoint customization is mostly done by overriding some :ref:`global settings
<global>`, but other unique settings are also available. Resource settings are
always lowercase.

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{6.5cm}|p{8.5cm}|

=============================== =========================================
``url``                         The endpoint URL. If omitted, the resource key 
                                of the ``DOMAIN`` dict will be used to build
                                the URL. As an example, ``contacts`` would make the
                                `people` resource available at ``/contacts/`` (instead of ``/people/``).

``filters``                     ``True`` if filters are enabled, ``False`` 
                                otherwise. Locally overrides ``FILTERS``.

``sorting``                     ``True`` if sorting is enabled, ``False`` 
                                otherwise. Locally ovverrides ``SORTING``.
                                
``pagination``                  ``True`` if pagination is enabled, ``False``

``resource_methods``            A list of HTTP methods supported at resource 
                                endpoint. Allowed values: ``GET``, ``POST``,

                                or earlier use the now unsupported ``methods``
                                keyword instead.

``public_methods``              A list of HTTP methods supported at resource
                                endpoint, open to public access even when
                                :ref:`auth` is enabled. Locally overrides
                                ``PUBLIC_METHODS``.

``item_methods``                A list of HTTP methods supported at item 
                                endpoint. Allowed values: ``GET``, ``PATCH``
                                and ``DELETE``. ``PATCH`` or, for clients not
                                supporting PATCH, ``POST`` with the
                                ``X-HTTP-Method-Override`` header tag.
                                Locally overrides ``ITEM_METHODS``.

                                endpoint, left open to public access when when
                                :ref:`auth` is enabled. Locally overrides
                                ``PUBLIC_ITEM_METHODS``.

``allowed_roles``               A list of allowed `roles` for resource
                                endpoint. See :ref:`auth` for more
                                informations. Locally overrides
                                ``ALLOWED_ROLES``.

``allowed_item_roles``          A list of allowed `roles` for item endpoint. 
                                See :ref:`auth` for more informations.
                                Locally overrides ``ALLOWED_ITEM_ROLES``.

``cache_control``               Value of the ``Cache-Control`` header field 
                                used when serving ``GET`` requests. Leave empty
                                if you don't want to include cache directives
                                with API responses. Locally overrides
                                ``CACHE_CONTROL``.

``cache_expires``               Value (in seconds) of the ``Expires`` header 
                                field used when serving ``GET`` requests. If
                                set to a non-zero value, the header will 
                                always be included, regardless of the setting
                                of ``CACHE_CONTROL``. Locally overrides
                                ``CACHE_EXPIRES``.

``item_lookup``                 ``True`` if item endpoint should be available, 
                                ``False`` otherwise. Locally overrides
                                ``ITEM_LOOKUP``.

``item_lookup_field``           Field used when looking up a resource
                                item. Locally overrides ``ITEM_LOOKUP_FIELD``.

``item_url``                    RegEx used to construct item endpoint URL.
                                Locally overrides ``ITEM_URL``.

``item_title``                  Title to be used when building item references,

                                ``ITEM_TITLE``.

``additional_lookup``           RegEx defining and additional, custom read-only item
                                endpoint. See the example below.

``datasource``                  Explicitly links API resources to database 
                                collections. See `Advanced Datasource
                                Patterns`_. 

``auth_username_field``         Enables :ref:`user-restricted`. When the
                                feature is enabled users can only
                                read/update/delete resource items created by
                                themselves. The keyword contains the actual
                                name of the field used to store the username of
                                the user who created the resource item. Locally
                                overrides ``AUTH_USERNAME_FIELD``.

``allow_unknown``               When ``True`` this option will allow insertion
                                and edition of arbitrary, unknown fields to
                                the endpoint. Use with caution. Locally
                                overrides ``ALLOW_UNKNOWN``. See :ref:`unknown`
                                for more informations. Defaults to ``False``.

``projection``                  When ``True`` this option enables the
                                :ref:`projections` feature. Locally overrides
                                ``PROJECTION``. Defaults to ``True``.

``extra_response_fields``       Allows to configure a list of additional
                                document fields that should be provided with
                                every POST response. Normally only
                                automatically handled fields (``ID_FIELD``,
                                ``LAST_UPDATED``, ``DATE_CREATED``, ``etag``)
                                are included in response payloads. Overrides
                                ``EXTRA_RESPONSE_FIELDS``. 

``mongo_write_concern``         A dictionary defining MongoDB write concern
                                settings for the endpoint datasource. All
                                stadard write concern settings (w, wtimeout, j,
                                fsync) are supported. Defaults to ``{'w': 1}``
                                which means 'do regular aknowledged writes'
                                (this is also the Mongo default.)

                                Please be aware that setting 'w' to a value of
                                2 or greater requires replication to be active
                                or you will be getting 500 errors (the write
                                will still happen; Mongo will just be unable
                                to check that it's being written to multiple
                                servers.)
                                
``schema``                      A dict defining the actual data structure being
                                handled by the resource. Enables data
                                validation. See `Schema Definition`_.
=============================== =========================================

Here's an example of resource customization, mostly done by overriding global
API settings:

::

    people = {
        # 'title' tag used in item links. Defaults to the resource title minus
        # the final, plural 's' (works fine in most cases but not for 'people')
        'item_title': 'person',

        # by default the standard item entry point is defined as
        # '/people/<ObjectId>/'. We leave it untouched, and we also enable an
        # additional read-only entry point. This way consumers can also perform 
        # GET requests at '/people/<lastname>/'.
        'additional_lookup': {
            'url': '[\w]+',
            'field': 'lastname'
        },

        # We choose to override global cache-control directives for this resource.
        'cache_control': 'max-age=10,must-revalidate',
        'cache_expires': 10,

        # we only allow GET and POST at this resource endpoint.
        'resource_methods': ['GET', 'POST'],
    }

.. _schema:

Schema Definition
-----------------
Unless your API is read-only you probably want to define resource `schemas`.
Schemas are important because they enable proper validation for incoming
streams.

::

    # 'people' schema definition
    'schema'= {
        'firstname': {
            'type': 'string',
            'minlength': 1,
            'maxlength': 10,
        },
        'lastname': {
            'type': 'string',
            'minlength': 1,
            'maxlength': 15,
            'required': True,
            'unique': True,
        },
        # 'role' is a list, and can only contain values from 'allowed'.
        'role': {
            'type': 'list',
            'allowed': ["author", "contributor", "copy"],
        },
        # An embedded 'strongly-typed' dictionary.
        'location': {
            'type': 'dict',
            'schema': {
                'address': {'type': 'string'},
                'city': {'type': 'string'}
            },
        },
        'born': {
            'type': 'datetime',
        },
    }

As you can see, schema keys are the actual field names, while values are dicts
defining the field validation rules. Allowed validation rules are:

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{6.5cm}|p{8.5cm}|

=============================== ==============================================
``type``                        Field data type. Can be one of the following:
                                ``string``, ``integer``, ``boolean``,
                                ``float``, ``datetime``, ``dict``, ``list``,
                                ``objectid``.

``required``                    If ``True`` the field is mandatory on
                                insertion.

``readonly``                    If ``True`` the field is readonly.

``minlength``, ``maxlength``    Minimum and maximum length allowed for
                                ``string`` and ``list`` types.

``min``, ``max``                Minimum and maximum values allowed for
                                ``integer`` types.

``allowed``                     List of allowed values for ``string`` and 
                                ``list`` types.

``empty``                       Only applies to string fields. If ``False``
                                validation will fail if the value is empty. 
                                Defaults to ``True``.

``items``                       Defines a list of values allowed in a ``list`` 
                                of fixed length.

``schema``                      Validation schema for ``dict`` types and 
                                arbitrary length ``list`` types. For details 
                                and usage examples, see :ref:`Cerberus documentation <cerberus:schema>`

``unique``                      The value of the field must be unique within
                                the collection.

                                Please note: validation constraints are checked
                                against the database, and not between the
                                payload documents themselves. This causes an
                                interesting corner case: in the event of
                                a multiple documents payload where two or more
                                documents carry the same value for a field
                                where the 'unique' constraint is set, the
                                payload will validate successfully, as there
                                are no duplicates in the database (yet). 
                                
                                If this is an issue, the client can always send
                                the documents once at a time for insertion, or
                                validate locally before submitting the payload
                                to the API.

``data_relation``               Allows to specify a referential integrity rule
                                that the value must satisfy in order to
                                validate. It is a dict with two keys:
                                ``collection``, which is the name of the
                                database collection being referenced, and
                                ``field``, the field name in the foreign
                                collection.

``nullable``                    If ``True`` the field value can be set to 
                                ``None``.

Schema syntax is based on Cerberus_ and yes, it can be extended.  In fact, Eve
itself extends the original grammar by adding the ``unique`` and
``data_relation`` keywords, along with the ``objectid`` datatype. For more
informations on custom validation and usage examples see :ref:`validation`.

In :ref:`local` you customized the `people` endpoint. Then, in this section,
you defined `people` validation rules. Now you are ready to update the domain
which was originally set up in `Domain Configuration`_:

::

    # add the schema to the 'people' resource definition
    people['schema'] = schema
    # update the domain
    DOMAIN['people'] = people

Advanced Datasource Patterns
----------------------------
The ``datasource`` keyword allows to explicitly link API resources to
database collections (if you omit it, the domain resource key is assumed to be
the name of the database collection itself). It is a dictionary with three allowed
keys: `source`, `filter` and `projection`. ``source`` dictates the database
collection consumed by the resource, ``filter`` expresses the underlying
query used to retrieve and validate data and ``projection`` allows to
redefine the exposed fieldset.


Predefined Database Filters
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Database filters for the API endpoint are set with the ``filter`` keyword.

::

    people = {
        'datasource': {
            'filter': {'username': {'$exists': True}}
            }
        }
  
In the example above the API endpoint for the `people` resource will only
expose and update documents with an existent `username` field.

Predefined filters run on top of user queries (GET requests with `where`
clauses) and standard conditional requests (`If-Modified-Since`, etc.)

Please note that datasource filters are applied on GET, PATCH and DELETE
requests. If your resource allows POST requests (document insertions),
then you will probably want to set the validation rules accordingly (in our
example, 'username' should probably be a required field).

Multiple API Endpoints, One Datasource
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Multiple API endpoints can target the same database collection. For
example you can set both ``/admins/`` and ``/users/`` to read and write from
the same `people` collection on the database.

::

    people = {
        'datasource': {
            'source': 'people', 
            'filter': {'userlevel': 1}
            }
        }

The above setting will retrieve, edit and delete only documents from the
`people` collection with a `userlevel` of 1.

Limiting the Fieldset Exposed by the API Endpoint
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
By default API responses to GET requests will include all fields defined by the
corresponding resource schema_. The ``projection`` setting of the `datasource`
resource keyword allows to redefine the fieldset.

::

    people = {
        'datasource': {
            'projection': {'username': 1}
            }
        }

The above setting will expose only the `username` field to GET requests, no
matter the schema_ defined for the resource. Please note that POST and PATCH
methods will still allow the whole schema to be manipulated. This feature can
come in handy when you want to protect insertion and edition behind an
:ref:`auth` scheme while leaving read access open to the public.
