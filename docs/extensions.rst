Eve-Elastic
-----------

| *by Petr Ja≈°ek*

Eve-Elastic_ is an elasticsearch data layer for the Eve REST framework.
Features facets support and the generation of mapping for schema. 

Eve-Mongoengine
---------------

| *by Stanislav Heller*

Eve-Mongoengine_ is an Eve extension, which enables Mongoengine ORM models to
be used as eve schema. If you use mongoengine in your application and
simultaneously want to use Eve, instead of writing schema again in Cerberus
format (DRY!), you can use this extension, which takes your mongoengine models
and auto-transforms them into Cerberus schema under the hood. 

Eve-Docs
--------

| *by Charles Flynn*

Eve-docs_ is a blueprint that generates documentation for Eve APIs in HTML and
JSON formats. Eve-docs creates the documentation from your existing Eve
configuration file, with no additional configuration required. For a nice
screenshot, check out the relevant blog post `Auto generate API docs`_.

Services with SQL-based backends.

Eve-OAuth2
