Extensions
==========

Welcome to the Eve extensions registry. Here you can find a list of packages
that extend Eve. This list is moderated and updated on a regular basis. If you
wrote a package for Eve and want it to show up here, just `get in touch`_ and
show me your tool! 

Eve-Elastic
-----------

| *by Petr Ja≈°ek*

Eve-Elastic_ is an elasticsearch data layer for the Eve REST framework.
Features facets support and the generation of mapping for schema. 

Eve-Mongoengine
---------------

| *by Stanislav Heller*

Eve-Mongoengine_ is an Eve extension, which enables Mongoengine ORM models to
be used as eve schema. If you use mongoengine in your application and
simultaneously want to use Eve, instead of writing schema again in Cerberus
format (DRY!), you can use this extension, which takes your mongoengine models
and auto-transforms them into Cerberus schema under the hood. 

Eve-Docs
--------

| *by Charles Flynn*

Eve-docs_ is a blueprint that generates documentation for Eve APIs in HTML and
JSON formats. Eve-docs creates the documentation from your existing Eve
configuration file, with no additional configuration required. For a nice
screenshot, check out the relevant blog post `Auto generate API docs`_.

Eve-Mocker
----------
*by Thomas Sileo*

`Eve-Mocker`_ is a mocking tool for Eve powered REST APIs, based on the
excellent HTTPretty, aimed to be used in your unit tests, when you rely on an
Eve API. Eve-Mocker has been featured on the Eve blog: `Mocking tool for Eve
APIs`_
