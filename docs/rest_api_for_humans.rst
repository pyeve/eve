REST API for Humans
===================
I have been introducing Eve at several conferences and meetups. A few people
suggested that I post the slides on the Eve website, so here it is: a quick
rundown on Eve features, along with a few code snippets and examples. Hopefully
it will do a good job in letting you decide whether Eve is valid solution for
your use case.
