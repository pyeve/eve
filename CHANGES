Eve Changelog
===============

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Eve release.

Version 0.0.2
-------------

Released on November 27th 2012.

- Homepage/api entry point resource links fixed. They had bad 'href'
  tags which also caused XML validation issues when processing responses
  (especially when accessing the API via browser).

- Version number in 'Server' response headers.

- Added support for DELETE at resource endpoints. Expected behavior:
  will delete all items in the collection. Disabled by default.

- :class:`eve.io.mongo.Validator` now supports :class:`~cerberus.Validator`
  signature, allowing for further subclassing.

Version 0.0.1
-------------

First public preview release.
