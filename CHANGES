- Boolean values in request forms are now correctly parsed.

Version 0.0.2
-------------

Released on November 27th 2012.

- Homepage/api entry point resource links fixed. They had bad 'href'

- Added support for DELETE at resource endpoints. Expected behavior:
  will delete all items in the collection. Disabled by default.

  signature, allowing for further subclassing.
