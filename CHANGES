Eve Changelog
=============

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Eve release.

Version 0.0.7
-------------

Not released yet.

Version 0.0.6
-------------

Released on May 13th 2013.

- Content-Type header now properly parsed when additional arguments are
  included (Ondrej Slinták).

- Only fields defined in the resource schema are now returned from the 
  database. Closes #52.

- Default SERVER_NAME is now set to 127.0.0.1:5000.

- 'auth_username_field' is honored even when there is no query in the request
  (Thomas Sileo).

- Pagination links in XML payloads are now properly escaped. Fixes #49.

- HEAD requests supported. Closes #48.

- Event Hooks. Each time a GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE method has been executed,
  both global 'on_<method>' and resource-level 'on_<method>_<resource>'
  events will be raised. You can subscribe to these events with multiple
  callback functions. Callbacks will receive the original flask.request object
  and the response payload as arguments.

    >>> def general_callback(resource, request, payload):
    ...  print 'A GET on the "%s" endpoint was just performed!' % resource

    >>> def contacts_callback(request, payload):
    ... print 'A get on 'contacts' was just performed!'

    >>> app = Eve()
    >>> app.on_get += general_callback
    >>> app.on_get_contacts += contacts_callback

    >>> app.run()
  
- Proper max_results handling in eve.utils.parse_request, refactored tests
  (Tomasz Jezierski).

- Projections. Projections are conditional queries where the client dictates
  which fields should be returned by the API (Nicolas Bazire).

- 'ALLOW_UNKNOWN' option, and the corresponding 'allow_options' local setting,
  allow for a less strict schema validation. Closes #34.

- ETags are now provided with POST responses. Closes #36.

- PATCH performance improvement: ETag is now computed in memory; performing an
  extra database lookup is not needed anymore.
          
- Bulk Inserts on the database. POST method heavily refactored to take
  advantage of MongoDB native support for Bulk Inserts. 
  
  Please note: validation constraints are checked against the database, and not
  between the payload documents themselves. This causes an interesting corner
  case: in the event of a multiple documents payload where two or more
  documents carry the same value for a field where the 'unique' constraint is
  set, the payload will validate successfully, as there are no duplicates in
  the database (yet). If this is an issue, the client can always send the
  documents once at a time for insertion, or validate locally before submitting
  the payload to the API.

- Responses to document GET requests now include the ETag in both the header
  and the payload. Closes #29.

- 'methods' settings keyword renamed to 'resource_methods' for coherence with 
  the global RESOURCE_METHODS (Nicolas Carlier).

Version 0.0.5
-------------

Released on April 11th 2013.

- Fixed an issue that apparently caused the test suite to only run 
  successfully on the dev box. Thanks Chronidev for reporting this.

- Referential integrity validation via the new 'data_relation' schema keyword.
  Closes #25.

- Support for 'Content-Type: application/json' for POST and PATCH methods. 
  Closes #28.

- User-restricted resource access. Works in conjunction with Authentication.
  When enabled, users can only read/update/delete resource items created by
  themselves. Can be switched on and off at global level via the
  AUTH_USERFIELD_NAME keywork, or at single resource endpoints with the
  user_userfield_name keyword (the latter will override the former). The
  keyword contains the actual name of the field used to store the username of
  the user who created the resource item. Defaults to '', which disables the
  feature (Thomas Sileo).

- PAGING_LIMIT keyword setting renamed to PAGINATION_LIMIT for better coherency
  with the new PAGINATION keyword. This could break backward compatibility in
  some cases.

- PAGING_DEFAULT keyword settings renamed to PAGINATION_DEFAULT for better
  coherence with the new PAGINATION keyword. This could break backward
  compatibility in some cases.

- ITEM_CACHE_CONTROL removed as it seems unnecessary at the moment.

- Added an example on how to handle events to perform custom actions. Closes 
  #23 and #22.

- ``eve.validation_schema()`` now collects offending items and returns all of
  them into the exception message. Closes #24.

- Filters (`?where=`), sorting (`?sort=`) and pagination (`?page=10`) can now
  be be disabled at both global and endpoint level. Closes #7.

- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) support. The new ``X-DOMAINS`` keywords
  allows API maintainers to specify which domains are allowed to perform CORS
  requests. Allowed values are: None, a list of domains, or '*' for a wide-open
  API. Closes #1.

- HMAC (Hash Message Authentication Code) based Autentication. 
  The new ``eve.auth.HMACAuth`` class allows for custom Amazon S3-like
  authentication, which is basically a very secure custom authentication
  scheme built around the `Authorization` header.

  HOW HMAC AUTHENTICATON WORKS
  The server provides the client with a user id and a secret key through some
  out-of-band technique (e.g., the service sends the client an e-mail
  containing the user id and secret key). The client will use the supplied
  secret key to sign all requests.

  When the client wants to send a request he builds the complete request and
  then using the secret key computes a hash over the complete message body (and
  optionally some of the message headers if required) 
  
  Next the client add the computed hash and his userid to the message in the
  Authorization header:
  
    Authorization: johndoe:uCMfSzkjue+HSDygYB5aEg==
  
  and sends it to the service. The service retrieves the userid from the
  message header and searches the private key for that user in its own
  database. Next he computes the hash over the message body (and selected
  headers) using the key to generate its hash. If the hash the client sends
  matches the hash the server computes the server knows the message was send by
  the real client and was not altered in any way.  
  
  Really the only tricky part is sharing a secret key with the user and keeping
  that secure. That is why some services allow for generation of shared keys
  with a limited life time so you can give the key to a third party to
  temporarily work on your behalf. This is also the reason why the secret key
  is generally provided through out-of-band channels (often a webpage or, as
  said above, an email or plain old paper).

  The HMACAuth class also support access roles. See the BasicAuth class
  introduced with v0.0.4 for details on how to restrict access to API
  resources.

  The `examples/security` folder contains a simple HMAC-Auth example.

- Token Based Authentication, a variation of Basic Authentication. Closes #20.
- Orphan function removed (``eve.methods.get.standard_links`` ).
- DATE_CREATED and LAST_UPDATED fields now show default values for documents
  created outside the API context. Fixes #18. 

Version 0.0.4
-------------

Released on February 25th 2013.

- Consistent ETag computation between runs/instances. Closes #16.
- Support for Basic Authentication (RFC2617). 

  BASICS
  A new ``eve.auth.BasicAuth`` class has been added. It should be subclassed in
  order to implement custom authentication.  The base class implements all the
  logic, you only need to override the check_auth() method. When you
  instantiate the Eve app, you pass the custom class like this:

    from eve.auth import BasicAuth

    class MyBasicAuth(BasicAuth):
        def check_auth(self, username, password, allowed_roles):
            return username == 'admin' and password == 'secret'

    app = Eve(auth=MyBasicAuth)
    app.run()

  All your API endpoints are now secured which means that a client will need
  to provide the correct credentials in order to consume the API:

    $ curl -i http://example.com/

    HTTP/1.0 401 UNAUTHORIZED
    WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm:"eve"
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 33
    Server: Eve/0.0.4 Werkzeug/0.8.3 Python/2.7.3
    Date: Thu, 14 Feb 2013 14:21:11 GMT

    Please provide proper credentials.


    $ curl -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0" -i http://example.com/
    
    HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 194
    Server: Eve/0.0.4 Werkzeug/0.8.3 Python/2.7.3
    Date: Thu, 14 Feb 2013 14:23:39 GMT

  By default, access is restricted to *all* endpoints, for *all* HTTP verbs
  (methods), effectively locking down the whole API.

  FINE-TUNING GLOBAL SECURITY 
  You might want a public read-only API where only authorized users
  can write, edit and delete. You can achieve that by using the new
  `PUBLIC_METHODS` and `PUBLIC_ITEM_METHODS` global options. Add the following to
  your ``settings.py``:
  
    PUBLIC_METHODS = ['GET'] 
    PUBLIC_ITEM_METHODS = ['GET']
  
  And run your API. POST, PATCH and DELETE are still restricted while GET is
  publicly available at all API endpoints. `PUBLIC_METHODS` refers to resource
  endpoints (`/people/`) while `PUBLIC_ITEM_METHODS` refers to individual
  items (`/people/id/`).
  
  FINE-TUNING ENDPOINT SECURITY
  Suppose that you want to allow public read access to only certain resources.
  You do that by declaring public methods at resource level, when declaring the
  API schema:

    'people': {
        'public_methods': ['GET'],
        'public_item_methods': ['GET'],
        ...
        }

  Be aware that, when present, resource-level settings override global-level
  settings. You can use this at your advantage. Suppose that you want to grant
  read access to all endpoints with the only exception of ``/invoices/``.  You
  first open up read access to all endpoints:

    PUBLIC_METHODS = ['GET'] 
    PUBLIC_ITEM_METHODS = ['GET']

  And then protect the private endpoint:

    'invoices': {
        'public_methods': [],
        'public_item_methods': [],
        ...
        }

  Effectively making `people` a restricted resource.

  ROLE ACCESS CONTROL
  The BasicAuth subclass above deliberately ignores the ``allowed_roles``
  parameter. You can use that parameter to restrict access to authenticated
  users who have been assigned specific roles. First you would use the new
  `ALLOWED_ROLES` and `ALLOWED_ITEM_ROLES` global directives (or the
  corresponding `allowed_roles` and `allowed_item_roles` resource keywords).

    ALLOWED_ROLES = ['admin']
  
  Then your subclass would implement the authorization logic by making good use
  of the aforementioned ``allowed_roles`` parameter. 
  
  EXAMPLE SNIPPETS
  The `examples/security` folder in the Eve repository contains some sample
  snippets, like bcrypt/SHA1-HMAC password matching and role access control.

- Support for all standard Flask initialization parameters.
- Support for default values in resource fields. The new 'default' keyword can
  now be used when defining a field rule set.

    'userlevel': {
        'type': 'integer', 
        'default': 1
        }

  When serving POST (create) requests, the 'userlevel' field (with a value of
  1) will be injected in documents lacking it. 
  
  Please note: currently default values are supported only for main document
  fields. Default values for fields in embedded documents will be ignored.

- Multiple API endpoints can now target the same database collection. For
  example now you can set both '/admins/' and '/users/' to read and write from
  the same collection on the db, 'people'.
 
  The new 'datasource' setting allows to explicitly link API resources to
  database collections. It is a dictionary with two allowed keys: 'source' and
  'filter'. 'source' dictates the database collection consumed by the resource.
  'filter' is the underlying query, applied by the API when retrieving and
  validating data for the resource.  

    'datasource': {
        'source': 'people', 
        'filter': {'userlevel': 1}
        }
  
  Previously, the resource name would dictate the linked datasource (and of
  course you could not have two resources with the same name). This remains
  the default behaviour: if you omit the 'datasource' setting for a resource,
  its name will be used to determine the database collection.

- It is now possibile to set predefined db filters for each resource. 

    'datasource': {
        'filter': {'username': {'$exists': True}}
        }
  
  In the example above the API endpoint will only expose (and update) documents
  with the 'username' field.

  Predefined filters run on top of user queries (GET requests with 'where'
  clauses) and standard conditional requests ('If-Modified-Since', etc.)

  Please note that datasource filters are applied on GET, PATCH and DELETE
  requests. If your resource allows for POST requests (document insertions),
  then you will probably want to set the validation rules accordingly (in our
  example, 'username' should probably be a required field).

- JSON-Datetime dependency removed.
- Support for Cerberus v0.0.3 and later.
- Support for Flask-PyMongo v0.2.0 and later.
- Repeated XML requests to the same endpoint could occasionally return an
  Internal Server Error (Fixes #8).

Version 0.0.3 
-------------

Released on January 22th 2013.

- XML rendering love. Lots of love.

- JSON links are always wrapped in a ``_links`` dictionary. Key values match
  the relation between the item being represented and the linked resource.

- Streamlined JSON responses.  
  
  Superflous ``response`` root key has been removed from JSON payloads. 

  GET requests to resource endpoints: items are now wrapped with an ``_items``
  list. 
  
  GET requests to item endpoints: item is now at root level, with no wrappers
  around it. 

- Support for API versioning through the new API_VERSION configuration setting.
- Boolean values in request forms are now correctly parsed.
- Tests now run under Python 2.6.


Version 0.0.2
-------------

Released on November 27th 2012.

- Homepage/api entry point resource links fixed. They had bad 'href'
  tags which also caused XML validation issues when processing responses
  (especially when accessing the API via browser).

- Version number in 'Server' response headers.

- Added support for DELETE at resource endpoints. Expected behavior:
  will delete all items in the collection. Disabled by default.

- :class:`eve.io.mongo.Validator` now supports :class:`~cerberus.Validator`
  signature, allowing for further subclassing.

Version 0.0.1
-------------

Released on November 20th 2012.

- First public preview release.
